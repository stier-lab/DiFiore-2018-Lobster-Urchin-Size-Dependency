## Lobster Urchin project to do
#-------------------------------------------


#-------------------------------------------
# Writing 
#-------------------------------------------

Write introduction
	- clean up P1
	- write body size paragraph (p2) 
	- write p3


Write discussion
	- write an outline
	

Prepare supplement


#-------------------------------------------
# Analysis
#-------------------------------------------


# High priority

_______________________________________________________________________________________Fix results to include arena area (137 x 76 cm, 46 cm water depth). 
	So 137/2 x 76 x 35

Fix model III to include posterior predictives and calculate % of variance in raw data explained by the model

Adapt scaling analysis to use lobster size and density and urchin density at the reef scale, and urchin size at the scale of the single transect.

__________________________________________________________________________________Complete alternate Fig 6. That includes a map of the channel

__________________________________________________________________________________Estimate how much of the variation in the data can be accounted for by the predictors? (i.e. predator and prey body size) 
	-https://avehtari.github.io/bayes_R2/bayes_R2.html#34_lowbwt_%E2%80%93_logistic_regression - resource for how to calculate a bayesian R2
	-spent way too much time trying to figure this out. Need to go to an expert. 


Fix figure 5 so that it accurately reflects what MTE predicts and does not predict. Also include empirical (i.e. Rall) predictions


Deal with the wAIC estimation for the generalized ricker vs. power law function for the allometric scaling of attack rates.



#Low priority

Redue the model analysis for figure 2 -- make bayesian 

Rebuild Fig. 1 -- histograms

Replace Fig. 1b with Figure S1? Not sure but the supplemental version seems to be more important...

Generate posterior predictions for each individual based on model 3 - This isn't essential but I think should be included as a supplemental figure

Out of sample analysis??? -- likely wait till the review stage on this




#-------------------------------------------
# Logistical
#-------------------------------------------


Update README.md file

Clean each core code file (1-8) and add comments

Review raw data and ensure that data was cleaned sufficiently

## Completed
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


____________________________________________________________________________________Revise results
_____________________________________________________________________________________Write results paragraph about predictions to observational data

____________________________________________________________________________________Revise methods in light of "third" model, specifically in Methods section D

_____________________________________________________Clean up repo

_____________________________________________________________Build figure for observational data
	- _____________________________________________________add null to the observational analysis. Plot predictions from the null model relative to the predictions from the size-structured model

____________________________________________________________Finish third model


_____________________________________________________________Build fig. 2 by biomass: does everything collapse when viewed on a per g basis?

_____________________________________________________________Build JAGs model with no size structure
