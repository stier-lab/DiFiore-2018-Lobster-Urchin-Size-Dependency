# count df
date(year, month, day), site, transect (or however it is uniquely defined), species, density (ind. per m2)

# size df 
date(year, month, day), site, transect (or however it is uniquely defined), species, size
	- each row is a different individual, with the metadata repeated across individuals

# biomass df (do this later!!!) 
date(year, month, day), site, transect (or however it is uniquely defined), species, biomass


# workflow 

1. Build Pisco data sets for counts and size. 
	- lobster size is nested within the count dataframe so this will have to be summarized to get counts, and then subset to get sizes for the size df 

2. Combine LTER and PISCO size dfs 

3. Combine LTER and PISCO count dfs

4. Build some simple LME's looking for correlations between lobster size and urchin size. I would expect sites with larger lobsters would have larger urchins... 

5. Build some simple LME's looking for correlations between lobster abundance and urchin abundance. I would expect sites with more lobsters would have fewer urchins... maybe...

6. Construct histograms

7. Build two 3 panel figure: a & b are size/abundance histograms of lobsters and urchins, and c) the bottom panel is urchin size/abundance ~ lobster size/abundance.

# Ok so this establishes the pattern... then we tested the size-dependence of the functional response to explore the mechanism behind the pattern
